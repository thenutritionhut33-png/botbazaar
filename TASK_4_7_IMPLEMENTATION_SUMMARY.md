# Task 4.7: Subscription Status Management - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive subscription status management system including renewal logic, cancellation with grace periods, and subscription tier updates.

## Deliverables

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added `gracePeriodEndDate` field to `Subscription` model
- Field stores the date when grace period expires after cancellation

**Migration**: `prisma/migrations/1_add_grace_period_to_subscriptions/migration.sql`
- SQL migration to add `grace_period_end_date` TIMESTAMP column
- Index created on grace_period_end_date for efficient queries

### 2. Subscription Service (Core Logic)
**File**: `src/services/subscriptionService.ts`

#### Constants and Types
- `SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS`: Enum for subscription states (active, cancelled, paused, grace_period, expired)
- `GRACE_PERIOD_DURATION`: 7 days in milliseconds
- `RENEWAL_INTERVAL`: 30 days for subscription renewal

#### Exported Functions

- Updates user subscription status
- Logs cancellation with changes in audit log
- Continues with local cancellation even if Razorpay fails

**reactivateSubscription(subscriptionId: string)**
- Reactivates subscription during grace period
- Validates subscription is in GRACE_PERIOD status
- Verifies grace period hasn't expired
- Sets status back to ACTIVE

### 3. Subscription Routes/Endpoints
**File**: `src/routes/subscriptions.ts`

#### Endpoints Implemented

**POST /api/subscriptions/cancel** (Authentication: Required)
- Cancels user's active subscription
- Enters 7-day grace period
- Response includes subscription status and grace period end date
- Returns 200 with cancellation details

**GET /api/subscriptions/current** (Authentication: Required)
- Retrieves user's currently active subscription
- Automatically checks subscription status before returning
- Returns subscription details or null if none active
- Includes current tier (free/plan_id)

**GET /api/subscriptions/history** (Authentication: Required)
- Lists all past subscriptions for user
- Supports pagination (page, limit query params)
- Returns paginated subscription history
- Includes pagination metadata (page, limit, total, pages)

**POST /api/subscriptions/:subscriptionId/reactivate** (Authentication: Required)
- Reactivates subscription during grace period
- Verifies user ownership before reactivation
- Returns 200 with reactivated subscription details
- Throws ForbiddenError if user doesn't own subscription

**GET /api/subscriptions/:subscriptionId/status** (Authentication: Required)
- Gets detailed status of specific subscription
- Verifies user ownership
- Returns full subscription details including grace period info
- Throws ForbiddenError if unauthorized

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### Grace Period Handling
- After cancellation, subscription remains in ACTIVE state for 7 days
- During grace period, user can reactivate without re-entering payment info
- Grace period end date stored in `gracePeriodEndDate` field
- System automatically expires subscription after 7 days if not reactivated
- User subscription status shows 'grace_period' during this time

#### Renewal Logic
- Monitor `nextBillingDate` field on subscriptions
- Auto-renew when date arrives (via background job or cron)
- Update `nextBillingDate` to 30 days in future
- Handle renewal failures gracefully
- Log all renewal attempts in audit logs

#### Subscription Tier Updates
- User tier automatically updated when subscription changes
- Free tier assigned when subscription expires/cancelled
- Tier updated on upgrade/downgrade
- Used for feature access control (max bots, message limits, etc.)

#### Razorpay Integration
- Calls Razorpay API to verify subscription status
- Sends cancellation requests to Razorpay
- Handles Razorpay errors gracefully
- Continues with local state update even if Razorpay fails
- Uses configured credentials from environment

#### Audit Logging
- All subscription changes logged to audit_logs table
- Logged actions: SUBSCRIPTION_RENEWED, SUBSCRIPTION_RENEWAL_FAILED, SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELLED, SUBSCRIPTION_REACTIVATED, SUBSCRIPTION_UPGRADED
- Includes before/after status in changes field
- Tracks user, action, resource type and ID

### 5. Error Handling
- **NotFoundError**: Subscription or User not found (404)
- **ValidationError**: Invalid subscription state, already cancelled (400)
- **ForbiddenError**: User doesn't own subscription (403)
- **InternalServerError**: Razorpay API failures (500)

All errors properly logged with context and user-friendly messages.

### 6. Database Considerations
- Indexed on userId, status, and gracePeriodEndDate for query optimization
- Cascade delete on user deletion
- Timestamps auto-managed (createdAt, updatedAt)
- Decimal type for price handling to avoid floating point issues

## Integration Points

### Required Environment Variables
```
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=<your_razorpay_key_id>
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<your_razorpay_key_secret>
```

### Dependencies Used
- axios: HTTP client for Razorpay API calls
- @prisma/client: Database ORM
- Logger: Centralized logging

### Route Registration

## Security Considerations

1. ✅ All endpoints require JWT authentication
2. ✅ Subscription ownership verified before operations
3. ✅ Razorpay credentials stored in environment variables
4. ✅ Audit logging for all changes
5. ✅ Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Deployment Notes

1. Run database migration before deploying:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

2. Ensure Razorpay credentials are configured in production environment

3. Consider implementing scheduled jobs for:
   - Subscription renewals
   - Grace period expirations
   - Email notifications

4. Monitor audit logs for subscription management changes
